# Knowledge base format

`init-kb.mjs` creates this tree. `check-kb.mjs` validates it. Field labels, IDs and file names stay in English; prose follows the user's language.

## IDs

Take the next free number with `node <skill>/scripts/check-kb.mjs <kb> --next`. Three digits, never reused.

| Prefix | Item | Defined by |
|---|---|---|
| `F-` | Feature | First cell of a row in `inventory/features.md` |
| `S-` | Screen | File `screens/S-###-*.md`, or first cell in `inventory/screens.md` |
| `C-` | Component | File `components/C-###-*.md` |
| `FL-` | Flow | File `flows/FL-###-*.md` |
| `R-` | Rule | Heading `### R-###` in `rules/*.md` |
| `E-` | Entity | File `data-model/entities/E-###-*.md` |
| `BR-` | Production barrier | Heading `### BR-###` in `clone/barriers.md` |
| `B-` | Finding | Heading or first cell in `findings.md` |
| `Q-` | Question | Heading or first cell in `questions.md` |
| `SRC-` | Public source | First cell in `sources.md` |
| `EV-` | Evidence | File `evidence/EV-###-*` |
| `L-` | Ledger row | First column of `sandbox/ledger.csv` |

Any other mention of an ID is a reference. Every reference must resolve to a definition. HTML comments and fenced code blocks are ignored.

## Evidence

- Save every screenshot and script output to `evidence/` at once, named `EV-###-<slug>.<ext>`. Slug: screen and state, for example `EV-031-deal-next-activity-dialog.png`.
- Mask personal data before capture (L3, L4).
- Tag every claim: `[obs EV-###]`, `[net EV-###]`, `[doc SRC-###]`, or `[inf]` with a `Q-###` on the same line.
- Script outputs (`inventory.js`, `tokens.js`, `api-shapes.js`) are evidence: save the JSON as `EV-###-<script>-<screen>.json`.
- Add a row to `evidence/index.csv` for each file: `id,date,session,route,shows,masked`. The date tells engineers how old a claim is; products change weekly.
- A screenshot that shows unmasked personal data is deleted and retaken. It never enters the KB or git.

## STATUS.md

Keep these sections, in this order:

```markdown
# Status: <Product>
Updated: 2026-10-15 · Session: s03 · Phase: 5 Deep dive
Environment: L3 · Sandbox: 🧪 [RE] Sandbox (space Personal) · Open ledger rows: 0

## Summary
- Covered: board, task view, dates (F-001 to F-006). 24 rules.
- Not covered: automations and permissions, read only at L3 (not exercised).
- Decide: create a trial account (L1) to test them.

## Next actions
1. F-012 Board drag and drop: ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Needs human
- Create a trial account in a separate browser profile (L1) to test permissions (F-030).

## Blocked
- F-021 Automations: L3 forbids A4. Needs L1.

## Last session
- Covered F-010, F-011. 6 rules, 2 components. See log/2026-10-15-s03.md.

## Residuals
- None.
```

`Open ledger rows` must be 0 at the end of every session. Rows left as test data for the next session take status `fixture`; rows the user decided to keep take `kept`; rows only the user can resolve take `human`. All three need a note.

## Coverage matrix

`inventory/coverage.md` is one table. Rows are features in priority order. Columns are aspects. Cell values: `todo`, `partial`, `done`, `blocked`, `n/a`. The last column holds notes (reason for `blocked`, files written).

```markdown
| Feature | Anatomy | States | Interactions | Rules | Data | Network | Keyboard and a11y | Persistence | Design | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 Board view | done | done | partial | done | done | done | done | done | done | drag not automatable |
```

## Session log

`log/<date>-s<NN>.md`: goal, what was covered (IDs), ledger rows added, incidents, decisions, what to do next. Append only.

## Git

Initialize the KB as its own git repository (`init-kb.mjs --git`), even inside another repository. Commit after each feature with the feature ID in the message. Masked evidence images are part of the commit.

## Handoff

`node <skill>/scripts/pack-kb.mjs <kb>` writes `REPORT.html` in the KB and `<kb>-handoff-<date>.zip` next to the KB folder:

- `REPORT.html` is one self-contained page for people, in reading order: overview (summary, numbers, coverage, decisions needed), what the product does, screens, components, flows, how it behaves (rules), data model, API, design system, build plan (with acceptance tests), before you launch (barriers), topics, findings, open questions, about this study (charter, glossary, sources), and an evidence gallery. A notice at the top, and a comment at the top of the source, tell AI agents to read `BUILD.md` instead. Images are embedded once and reused, and IDs are links. Its only script is an inline theme toggle and click-to-zoom, and its only network request is Google Fonts (it falls back to system fonts offline). `build-report.mjs <kb>` regenerates it alone.

- It runs `check-kb` first and stops on errors (`--force` packs anyway and says so).
- It adds `BUILD.md` from `templates/handoff/BUILD.md` if the KB has none. Edit it in the KB to add instructions for a specific team.
- It leaves out `sandbox/` and `log/`, which hold account and workspace details, and `_templates/`. `--full` includes them.
- It keeps a copy of `sandbox/ledger.csv` with `object_id` and `location` blanked and URLs replaced by `[url]`. The receiver sees what the study changed and how each change ended, and `check-kb --closing` passes on the unzipped folder. Keep other account details (workspace names, real values) out of the ledger's other columns.
- `--out <file.zip>` chooses the path.

Send the zip to the user in the chat. The receiver unzips it and gives the folder to a coding agent, starting from `BUILD.md`.

## Checks

`node <skill>/scripts/check-kb.mjs <kb>` reports:

- Errors: unresolved references, duplicate definitions, rules or barriers without evidence, invalid ledger rows, `fixture`, `kept`, `human` or `incident` rows without a note, missing `STATUS.md`; with `--closing`, an unfilled charter.
- Warnings: open ledger rows, `[inf]` lines without `Q-###`, features without a coverage row, artifact files without a "Not tested" section, entity field rows without an evidence tag, evidence files missing from `evidence/index.csv`, `STATUS.md` older than the newest log, template placeholders left in place.

Add `--closing` at the end of the study: `open`, `fixture` and `human` ledger rows become errors.
